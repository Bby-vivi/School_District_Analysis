# School_District_Analysis

## Summary

> During this analysis we were able to demonstrate a few findings. First off, we started by correcting the missing data. By correcting such data, it helped us to still preform with the analysis with necessary tools. Within our findings we performed a summary statistics for the data-frame by grade year, school type, school budget and academic subject. Furthermore, we added Student Counts data column by utilizing set data from previous data-sets.
